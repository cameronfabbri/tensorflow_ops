# Tensorflow-Functions

Available Functions:

- Convolution
- Fully Connected Layer
- Conv Transpose (Deconvolution)
- Dialated Convolution
- Leaky RELU
- multilayer_perceptron
- Also look into the different types of stuff you can print out like tf summary
- ADD TENSORBOARD to all my stuff
- clean up all git projects

- make a Tensorflow examples git
   - do it with all mnist, just easier to load in

Have the convolutions and fc and stuff return no activation function
so you can use w.e on it.
